    "description": "Firewalls pose a problem for data channel establishment in two-channel FTP-based protocols such as GridFTP. Common firewall configurations allow outbound connection requests but block all incoming connection requests. In other words, firewalls often block the path to a listener, thus making it impossible for the listening side of the FTP data channel to be properly contacted. Solutions such as opening a range of ports have been proposed but not embraced by security-conscious system administrators. \nHere the idea of single port GridFTP is proposed. Server will listen on single port (2811) for both control and data channels. \n- 2811 listener is a little more than current inetd-type process -- it will read one command from a connection to know whether to start a control or data process.\n- new connections come in on 2811 and give control channel auth command, and control channel process is forked.\n- on control channel, pasv-type command is sent, and response includes a host:2811:token.\n- data connection comes in again on 2811, gives data command, and data process is forked.\n- data chan process decrypts token with host cert or dummy stripe group cert, which tells it where to contact the control process.\n- data process auths to control process with user cred, or whatever it would normally use, and then token is used to determine data transfer details.\n- parallelism would always be 1 and multiple connections would only be supported via stripes.\n\nProblems:\n- parallel streams are very common, so now every connection takes N times as many resources as before.\n- new clients and new servers would be needed at all ends for this to work.  hurts when source server requires this but dest server is not updated.\n\nPossible fixes for problem #2:\n- Must require new client. have client send session id to both ends via delegated proxy.  new server would read that id from data channel auth to know where the data belongs.  The trick is in manipulating delegated cred to handle session id.  There is a trouble in that for any connection received on 2811, GridFTP banner message is sent. When the data connection from an old server get banner, it will die.  But this can be solved by having separate port for control and data (2811 for control and 2812 for data).\n- No need for new client. Ports 0-1023 are reserved and those values will not be send in the passive response by the existing servers. Single/dual port GridFTP server can use 0 -1023 as tokens and send it in the passive response. When the active server receives 0-1023 for port, it should know that this value is token and the server is actually is listening on 2811/2812. The problem is this will work only if there is new server on both ends.\n",
