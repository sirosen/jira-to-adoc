    "description": "The GRAM client API uses the io_compat API instead of XIO directly.  In order to set timeouts, the GRAM client API needs to use XIO directly.  This should be changed in GRAM5.\n\nJaime Frey wrote:\nToday, I investigated a problem observed by Igor Sfiligoi (CC'd) that I was hoping you could comment on. He's submitting Condor-G glideins to numerous sites. In the past couple days, all gram commands started returning connection failures, though the sites were functioning normally. His gahp_server had run out of fds (fd limit of 1024). All of the fds were tied up in established connections to 20 job-managers at one site, up to 100 connections to each job-manager. The number of connections to each job-manager was roughly equal to the number of gram commands the gahp had sent to that job-manager. The gahp was trying to read data off of the connections. When I killed the jobmanagers, all of the fds were quickly closed.\nThe gahp server was linked with Globus 4.0.5 libraries. The remote site appears to be running a late-2.4.x release of Globus. My question is why didn't the Globus libraries in the gahp server timeout on the connections after several minutes? Are timeouts off be default in globus_xio?",
